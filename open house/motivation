motivation

My motivation to join on the this bootcamp is always looking for the future that we have to adopt of our digital. Because the future is now not tomorrow or not next decades. If you can adopt the digital age means you have a lot to control. Then lastly I am motivated because I can a new title and a new career that means I will see my true clarity on what path I should choose. Thats all thank you.

My experience on this openhouse bootcamp, at first I am excited to learn something new. When during the session sometimes I can't go through because the languages weve uses are very new to me, ( hoping we have a class for languages and specially The " how and WHY" is it happen). Ive been experiencing some difficulties but eventhough our instructor is very considerable ( Sir Chris) he always keep the class that there is no left behind. Just like Jesus Christ doing, he left the 99 the sheeps in order to find the missing one in order to complete the 100. That is how described our instructor. He works like Jesus, teaches like Jesus eventhough I sense the tone of his voice that he feels being exhausted, but he is still patiently teach us in ordr that no one is left behind. Lastly for our activity we had the instructions already, when I executed it I feel amazed. Because I can make a command on my own discresion, I made some errors but I am enjoying to make a command again just like because of this experienced we are not being afraid to made simple mistakes. Because this mistakes are the opportunity to us to explore more, base on my experiences and I am very glad that I attend this session even I fell also the exhaustions after daywork before the class. That i s my great experience thanjk you.
